# A journal to my future self: 

Make it for you and you only, not for the teacher, not for the TA, not for the purpose of homeworks, not for the sake of grades. 

You love writing and you respect people who write, so you don't insult yourself by putting down things with no thought and no soul- at least you try not to. 

You have been there, you have done that, you struggled and you survived. One day you look back, you will feel nothing but only pride, because you know that the best thing in life are things that you have earned. 

Last but not the least, nobody deserves anything.
