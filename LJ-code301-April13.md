## LJ Code 301 - Day 3

The most problem I had on the first two days seemed to be with github flow, so I spent a lot of time on it and it became what I feel I learnt the most on, along with command line operations in general. 

Group work started to show its up and downs. There are moments I felt like why am I working with someone on my current level?! Team working and asking for help are never my strength. I am more a learning by reading and researching on her own kind of person. But there are definitely moments I felt like it’s good that I have a partner and definitely learned a thing or two from each one of them. 

I am taking too long to do everything right now, so even though I am literally running to the bathroom, somehow I am still behind. I have spent most of my time on the lab projects and reading the new materials that my personal portfolio is super neglected.  It looks like my weekend plan is sorted.  ☹
