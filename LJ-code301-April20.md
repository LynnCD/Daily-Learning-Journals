##LJ-code301-day 08

Pair programming started to click for me finally. For the first I think 6 projects, I have been doing the lab work at home then bringing my finished code to the lab session. It's partially due to my unfamiliarity with my pair, and partially due to my distrust in myself. I didn't know how it could play out and because of that, I assumed so much burden on myself and heavily sabotaged my personal portfolio because I could allocate any time on it. At my last lab work-my first girl pair, I didn’t do anything at home but went through the code line by line with my pair during the lab session. It went surprisingly well and we wrapped things up fast. I went to the lab session this morning without doing any work home again, and it went well also. My pair is more knowledge than me on the MVC structure and got to share his experience with it at work. I feel like I am suddenly gifted a chunk of time each day to do my own things.  Oh, I think CSS is like a black hole, once I start to mess around with it, I get carried away…then an hour later, nothing substantial happened.
