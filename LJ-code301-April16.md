LJ Code 301 - Day 5
Small pointers I have learnt:
1. Adding ‘sync’ in front of ‘src’ to tell javascript to load in the end to not slow down the page;
2. The order of script tab matters and how they should be properly ordered;
3. Application of CDN and CDN itself can have bugs, for example, for some amd.cnd type, an extra amd script tag is needed before the CDN tag itself;
4. Diagnosing and fixing website speed in chrome dev tool.

Things I could improve:
1. Lack of proficiency in jQuery events handling;
2. Tested into the class, shaky foundation in CSS styling-I don’t find it difficult but I know it will be time consuming to reach certain level of proficiency;
3. Data structure and algorithm is challenging to me right now
4. Writing learning journal is still not part of my habit so it always caught me by surprise at the homework due session, which kind of prohibited me from having deeper reflections. 
5. I’m in the middle of training for a half-marathon and starting coding bootcamp now messed up my training schedule and I am really disappointed in myself.
