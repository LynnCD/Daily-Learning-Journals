I probably shouldn't be writing this now because netheir my lab or my portofolio for today is done yet. But I need to jog it down when I have some discoveries:

1. I finally understand the callback function, now I don't understand why I didn't understand it before. It is literally as straight forward as its name suggests. It calls back a previous function. wow. What was wrong with me? 

2. I was very resistent to FP when I was just introduced to it-I could be stubborn sometimes, not good. I tried to rewrite some of my code in FP way so I could submit it for homework points... but after I wrote one, I couldn't stop. I am so in love! It helped me finding out the type of coder I am: I am a one-line coder! I understand things so much better when they are written in signle lines and it gives me great OCD kind of satisfaction to look at them after they got "fixed".
