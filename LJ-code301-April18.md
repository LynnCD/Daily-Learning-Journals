##LJ-code301-April18

With so many ways of formating the template and rendering to the HTML, I'm confused which one is which now. I probably need to go back and go through my code line by line.

I have finally come up with a system as for how to learn and cope with the pace/structure of the course. It involves making knowlege summaries daily with key points in the class agenda and my notes, and setting goals for how long the group project should take before I give up and moving onto another project, aka structuring my time more specifically. 

Now I am working the system retrospectively to pin point which part I had fallen behind. When my system is properly in place, 2 weeks of the classes will be aleady finished...
