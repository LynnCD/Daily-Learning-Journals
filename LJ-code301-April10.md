## LJ Code 301 - Day 1
The first day was a rather disoriented day for me. It's definately challenging to suddenly adapt to the bootcamp pace, and have skipped the 201 course made it even harder. It took me most of the day to try to figure out where things are located and get used to the sytems/tools the class uses. What have I learned? so many bits of knowlegdes here and there, the one I can think of now is that I finally found ou the difference between 'git checkout -b filename' and 'git branch filename'. Thought those two were confusing before.

Then in the morning, I spent the whole morning working with my pair who is a great help by showing me how the workflow looks like at the school. The project does seem to move on faster when working in a team and having someone to discuss the issues with. The hardest part comes when I were trying to do APC to github. Out of no where, all sorts of unexpected problems occurred. I found myself repeating in my head:"Don't give up. Don't give up." on multiple occasions. I think I need to study up more on github workflows. 

Overall, I had a tiring yet exciting day.
