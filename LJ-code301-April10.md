## LJ Code 301 - Day 1
The first day was a rather disoriented day for me. It's definately challenging to suddenly adapt to the bootcamp pace, and having skipped 201 made it even harder I assume. It took me most of the day to try to figure out where things were located and get used to the sytems/tools the class uses. I have learnt so many bits of knowlegdes here and there, one that I could think of now is that I finally found out the difference between 'git checkout -b filename' and 'git branch filename'. Thought those two were confusing before.

Then in the morning, I spent the whole morning working with my pair who is a great help by showing me how the workflow looks like at the school. The project did seem to move on faster when working in a team and having someone to discuss the issues with. The hardest part came when I were trying to do APC to github. Out of no where, all sorts of unexpected problems occurred. I found myself repeating in my head:"Don't give up." on multiple occasions. I think I need to study up more on github workflows. 

Overall, I had a tiring yet exciting day.
