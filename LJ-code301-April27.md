Have watched Nick doing debugger and console.log thing in class for a while now, I have only just tried it myself and realized how it actually works...I think I have been too resistent to the idea of "debugging", maybe also a little bit irresponsible by thinking "Erik will catch my bugs" ... 

I do code a little bit mindlessly when I work in a group, but do much better when I'm working on my own portfolio. Partially because it's harder to get into my thought when someone else is talking-I have very strong reactive attention, it could be an advantage but also a curse; also because, sometimes when your partner came up with something that you might not agree with, but you wonder if he just knows something you don't know. In the meanwhile, your partner might feel the same way. As a result, the code came out a bit...random?
