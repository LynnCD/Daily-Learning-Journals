#LJ-code301-day10

The second week of my coding boot camp has ended, which also means I am half way through 301.  My body has quickly adapted to my new sleeping hours and I even started running again.  If I were like a lost zombie in my first week, I have definately regained my sense slowly in my second week: I started to savor the moments I have spent with my classmates and the time I have had on campus, because I know one day, we will most likely be fading into each other’s memory and the time we spend together will just be *the past*.  In life, encounters as such are serendipities and shall be treasured.  The same applies to the teacher and TAs. 

I’d like to talk about the two *clicks* I had recently while learning.  The first one I noticed was that for some code I didn’t understand at all at the time (nor did I spend more time to try to understand it afterwards in this case), they would show up in my face some day(s) later, and I would have a ‘hey! I totally know you!’ moment.  Human brain is a magical thing. 

I have noticed when I asked Nick to help me with my linter error, he could find some missing bracket almost the moment I presented my computer to him and then even catch some other errors I was not aware of at all along the way; or when my husband glanced over my computer screen sometimes, he would know exactly what I was made to do without knowing any details of my homework.  It baffled me. Do they see the same screen I see?  How come I have to go through the same page line by line to understand them or sometimes couldn’t even? Frankly, staring at the same code for too long makes me dizzy sometimes.  Then, it suddenly clicked.  Programming languages are called “languages” not for no reason, and having gone through twice the process in my life outside of my mother tongue already, I might still not be an expert, but certainly am familiar with the drill.  I remember my first English word-it’s not ‘hello’, nor ‘good’; it’s ‘what’.  I remember the exact location of the word “what” on the page of my textbook.  I remember me spelling it out loud ‘w’ ‘h’ ‘a’ ‘t’, ‘ what’, ‘what’ followed by its Chinese meaning and repeating them five times.  Then, at one point, something interesting happened: I could basically just look at a word once and never forget about it anymore, in English.  This one, I don’t remember when but I remember it happened and I remember the feeling of enlightenment I felt.  When I moved onto French later on, it was much easier than the first round and I felt as if I had known French before but just forgot.

I know, I will be ***just fine***.
